# Databricks-Finance-DLT-Project
This project implements an end-to-end finance data platform using Databricks Delta Live Tables (DLT) and the Medallion Architecture. The pipeline ingests raw transaction data into a Bronze layer, applies data quality checks and transformations in the Silver layer, and produces business-ready Gold tables for daily financial KPIs and fraud analytics.
